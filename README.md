# Notification Center

With the release of Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8), Apple added a systemwide notification service called Notification Center to OS X which apps can use to inform the user of incoming messages, calendar alerts, etc.

Fortunately, Notification Center isnâ€™t limited to native apps, web apps can make use of it too.
